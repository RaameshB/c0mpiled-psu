# Philosophy

This codebase will outlive you. Every shortcut becomes someone else’s burden.
Every hack compounds into technical debt that slows the whole team down. You are
not just writing code. You are shaping the future of this project. The patterns
you establish will be copied. The corners you cut will be cut again. Fight
entropy. Leave the codebase better than you found it.

# Git Conventions

- Commit frequently, conventional commits, as you produce work
- Commits: `feat(scope): description`, `fix(scope): description`,
  `refactor(scope): description`
- Branches: Use kebab-case without prefixes (e.g.,
  `vehicle-chassis-model-overhaul`, not `feat/vehicle-chassis-model-overhaul`)
